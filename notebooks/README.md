# Accompanying data and processing steps for the sector-coupled Euro-Calliope

This directory contains scripts in the form of Jupyter Notebooks in which datasets are examined and processed outside the main workflow (`auxiliary_data_processing`), comparing data sources to show the background for some decisions made in the main workflow (`compare_datasets`), and the results of preliminary parameterisation test runs (`test_results`).
